# Project details

`points_by_age.R` - This code evaluates various point types by age and
produces scatter plots with linear regression lines showing the strength
and direction of the relationship.

`rank_by_age.R` - This code evaluates player ranking by age and produces
a scatter plot with a linear regression line showing the strength and
direction of the relationship.

`points_by_age_cat.R` - This code evaluates various point types by age
bands and produced box plots showing the distribution of points by age
bands.

`Data` - This chunk reads our data as a csv file from the environment

`player_eff. R` - This chunk of code reads in the data -This project
uses NBA box score data to calculate: 1. **Team-level shooting
efficiency** (field goals made vs. field goals attempted), 2.
**Player-level shooting efficiency**, and 3. A **Player Impact Score**
that includes offensive and defensive contributions.

For this analysis, I used field_goal as the measure of successful shots
and field_goal_atmpts as total attempts. These variables are both
reported per 36 minutes and reflect overall scoring efficiency. I then
created a success ratio (field_goal / field_goal_atmpts) and ranked
teams based on that efficiency score.

# Midterm Report

- To build the midterm report \[insert make rule\]

- It will build the `midterm_report.Rmd` file.

- To customize the midterm report, toggle the “env” value between
  “age_cont” and “age_cat.” “age_cont” will yield graphical outputs for
  the continuous age analysis, and “age_cat” will yield graphical
  outputs for the categorical age analysis. The default setting is the
  continuous analysis.
