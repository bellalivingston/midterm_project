"To capture a more complete picture of player contribution, I expanded the Player Impact Score to include defensive components — specifically steals and blocks. These metrics reflect a player's ability to disrupt possessions and protect the rim, adding essential context beyond scoring and rebounding alone. By combining points, total rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks, the updated score highlights true two-way players whose impact goes beyond the basic box score. The resulting rankings reveal which athletes consistently influence the game across all phases, not just on the offensive end."
